# Introduction
Pyro is an abbreviation for "**PY**thon-aware **RO**bot" editor.  It is a set of Eclipse plugins for developing automated testing code using the [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/).  Python awareness comes from a tight integration into the popular [PyDev](http://pydev.org/) development tools for Eclipse.  Many typical Eclipse capabilities are present in this Robot editor, including: syntax coloring, content assist, hyperlinking to local and external resources, Outline view integration, etc.

For more detailed information [see the Pyro wiki](https://github.com/millennialmedia/pyro/wiki)

# Quick start
* Pyro can be installed via [this update site](https://github.com/millennialmedia/pyro/raw/updatesite) using the Help->Install New Software... action in Eclipse.

* For full Python support, also make sure to separately install PyDev from the [PyDev update site](http://pydev.org/updates/).

* Restart Eclipse

* Now open a Robot source file using Pyro's editor, which is simply called _Robot Framework Editor_ within Eclipse.  It is contributed as a default editor for the ".robot", ".txt", and ".tsv" file extensions.  In cases of collisions with other editors, you can always choose from the **Open With->** menu option.   

* Refer to the Pyro wiki for more detailed setup instructions.
